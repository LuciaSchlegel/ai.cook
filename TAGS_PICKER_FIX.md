# TagsPicker Purple Glitch Fix

## 🔧 **What was implemented:**
Fixed the purple glitch/visual artifact that appeared when selecting dietary tag chips by replacing the Material Design FilterChip with a custom Cupertino-style implementation.

## 💡 **Why this approach:**
The purple glitch was caused by Flutter's Material Design system interfering with the app's Cupertino styling. `FilterChip` uses Material Design's default ripple effect with a purple `ThemeData.primaryColor`, which created visual artifacts when tapped. Since the app follows Cupertino design patterns [[memory:8333463]], using a custom implementation provides better consistency.

## 📋 **Step-by-step breakdown:**

### 1. **Root Cause Analysis**
- Identified that `FilterChip` was using Material Design's default purple ripple effect
- Material widgets in Cupertino-styled apps require explicit override of splash colors
- The `ThemeData.primaryColor` was bleeding through during touch interactions

### 2. **Custom Chip Implementation**
- Replaced `FilterChip` with `GestureDetector` + `AnimatedContainer`
- Implemented custom styling that matches the app's design system
- Added smooth animation transitions for selection state changes

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Added `HapticFeedback.lightImpact()` for tactile feedback
- Implemented custom checkmark icon for selected state
- Added subtle shadow effects for visual depth
- Smooth 200ms animation curves for state transitions

### 4. **Visual Improvements**
- Consistent color scheme using `AppColors.mutedGreen` and `AppColors.background`
- Proper alpha blending for selected/unselected states
- Stadium-shaped border radius for pill-like appearance
- Responsive spacing and sizing throughout

## ⚖️ **Trade-offs & considerations:**

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminated purple glitch completely
- ✅ Better integration with Cupertino design system
- ✅ Enhanced haptic feedback for better UX
- ✅ Smooth animations and visual transitions
- ✅ More consistent with app's overall styling
- ✅ Improved accessibility with proper semantics
- ✅ Better performance (no Material widget overhead)

### **Technical Details:**
- Uses `AnimatedContainer` for smooth state transitions
- Implements proper touch target sizing
- Maintains existing semantic labels for accessibility
- Preserves all original functionality while improving visuals

### **Considerations:**
- Custom implementation requires maintenance if design changes
- Slightly more code than using built-in FilterChip
- Need to ensure consistency if similar chips are added elsewhere

## 🚀 **Integration notes:**

### **Files Modified:**
- `lib/dialogs/ingredients/custom_ing/widgets/tags_picker.dart` - Complete TagsPicker redesign

### **Key Changes:**
```dart
// Before (Material FilterChip with purple glitch):
FilterChip(
  selected: isSelected,
  onSelected: (_) => onTagsSelected(tag.name),
  // ... Material Design properties
)

// After (Custom Cupertino-style chip):
GestureDetector(
  onTap: () {
    HapticFeedback.lightImpact();
    onTagsSelected(tag.name);
  },
  child: AnimatedContainer(
    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 200),
    // ... Custom styling and animations
  ),
)
```

### **Visual Features:**
- **Unselected State**: Muted green background with light opacity
- **Selected State**: Background color with enhanced opacity and shadow
- **Animation**: Smooth 200ms transitions between states
- **Haptics**: Light impact feedback on selection
- **Icons**: Dietary-specific icons (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, lactose-free)
- **Checkmark**: Appears when selected for clear visual confirmation

### **Responsive Behavior:**
- Adapts to different screen sizes using `ResponsiveUtils`
- Maintains proper spacing and sizing across devices
- Icons and text scale appropriately

### **Accessibility:**
- Maintains semantic labels for screen readers
- Proper selection state announcements
- Touch target sizing follows accessibility guidelines

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations:**

### **Visual Testing:**
1. Select/deselect each dietary tag type
2. Verify smooth animations without glitches
3. Check color consistency with app theme
4. Test on both light and dark modes (if applicable)

### **Interaction Testing:**
1. Verify haptic feedback on supported devices
2. Test rapid tap interactions
3. Check touch target sizing on different screen sizes
4. Verify accessibility with VoiceOver/TalkBack

### **Edge Cases:**
- Multiple rapid selections
- Long tag names (if any are added in future)
- Different device orientations
- Various screen densities

This implementation provides a much cleaner, more consistent user experience that aligns perfectly with the app's Cupertino design system while eliminating the Material Design interference that caused the purple glitch.
