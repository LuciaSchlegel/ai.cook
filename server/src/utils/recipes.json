        "steps": [
          "For the Dough: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Add the butter to the flour and salt mixture and toss to coat. Using clean hands, pinch the butter pieces flat. Gradually add water and mix with your hands until a slightly sticky dough forms. Transfer dough to a clean work surface and knead dough until it becomes soft and smooth, about 5 minutes. Place dough in a plastic bag or wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.",
          "Meanwhile, for the Filling: Working in 3 separate batches, place jerky in a blender and pulse several times to break it up. Turn blender to high speed and blend until jerky is soft, light, and fluffy, like coarse cotton candy, about 1 minute. Set aside.",
          "In a 5-quart Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onion and stir until evenly coated with oil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally to avoid scorching, until onion is soft and dark brown in color, about 20-30 minutes.",
          "Increase heat to medium, stir in beef jerky and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in tomato purée, green bell pepper, red bell pepper, white pepper, smoked paprika, thyme, and oregano, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until tomato sauce has reduced completely and bell peppers have softened, about 15 minutes. If tomato sauce reduces too much before bell peppers have cooked through completely, add water a tablespoon or two at a time to avoid scorching until pepper fully soften. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl and let cool. Once cool, stir in hard-boiled eggs and chives. Season with salt, if needed. Set aside.",
          "To Make the Empanada: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). Grease a rimmed baking sheet with butter. Using the palms of your hands, roll rested dough into a roughly 9-inch (24cm) cylinder. Cut into 24 pieces, approximately 30g each; each piece should be about the size of your thumb. Cover the pieces with plastic wrap or a damp cloth to prevent drying out. Working with one piece at a time, shape each piece of dough into a flattened disc. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough disc into a roughly 4-inch (10cm) circle.",
          "Holding the dough disc in the palm of one hand, place a tablespoon (approximately 35g) of meat filling in the center of the disc. Fold the dough over the filling to enclose it, forming a half-moon shape; use your fingers to gently seal the edges together while making sure to push out any air bubbles.",
          "Fold the right corner of empanada in towards the center and pinch to crimp. Working from that corner, continue crimping with a slight twisting motion to form points along the edge, so that the empanada looks like a half-sun with rays, then finish by folding the left corner in and pinching to crimp; be sure to work the dough gently to avoid air bubbles or tearing. Place formed empanada on prepared baking sheet and repeat process with remaining empanada discs and filling.",
          "Bake empanadas until dough is lightly browned on the exterior, about 25 minutes. Remove empanadas from oven and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes before serving."

Sprinkle lightly all over on both sides with salt, then let stand until eggplants look dewy with water and some water has dripped below, about 20 minutes. Blot well with clean towels to remove all excess water.",

Reduce heat to medium low and continue to cook until garlic is just beginning to turn golden, about 4 minutes. Remove garlic clove and discard. Add blended canned tomatoes (or passata) along with the basil and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer and cook, stirring often, until thickened and no longer watery (this may take almost no time at all for some passata products, or up to 20 minutes for waterier canned tomatoes). Remove from heat and season with salt. Set aside.",
          "In a 12-inch cast iron or stainless-steel skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, fry eggplant, turning once, until golden on both sides. Carefully transfer to paper towels to drain well, blotting to soak up any excess oil as you go. Repeat with remaining eggplant, adding more oil to skillet if necessary. Set aside.",
          "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare an ice bath in a large mixing bowl. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pot, boil lasagna noodles until just shy of al dente, about 2 minutes less than cooking instructions for fresh lasagna noodles or 3 minutes less than package instructions for dry lasagna noodles. Using a strainer and tongs, carefully transfer to ice bath to chill, then drain and blot lightly with towels. Repeat with remaining pasta.",
          "Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C) and set rack in middle position. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk ricotta until very smooth and creamy. Season with salt.",

Cutting cooked lasagna noodles as needed to fit the baking dish, arrange the pasta in a single, even layer. Dollop and gently spread a thin layer of ricotta all over pasta (it doesn't need to cover every inch, but should be evenly enough distributed that it will melt and spread when baked). Scatter a small handful of mozzarella all over, then pieces of fried eggplant in a single, even layer. Top with another thin layer of sauce, then a sprinkle of grated ricotta salata and a dusting of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Repeat this layering until the baking dish is full, making sure to top the final layer of pasta only with tomato sauce, ricotta, ricotta salata, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. (Note: You may not use up all the components, but you should make sure to use all the eggplant and ricotta when layering the dish.)",
          "Set baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet (to catch any drips) and bake until fully heated through and lasagna is very lightly browned on top, about 30 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes to cool and settle, then slice and serve, sprinkling torn fresh basil leaves on top."

          "For the Marinade: In a large bowl, mix together the wine, garlic, salt, juniper berries, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Add the rib pieces to the marinade, making sure they are fully submerged. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or up to 24 hours.",
          "For the Ragù: Remove ribs from marinade and pat dry with paper towels. Strain the marinade and discard solids. Set strained marinade aside.",
          "In a large Dutch oven or deep sauté pan, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in batches, brown the rib pieces, meaty side down, and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes. Transfer browned ribs to a clean plate and set aside.",
          "In now-empty Dutch oven, add remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil and heat over medium heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion, and cook stirring occasionally until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Add tomato paste, garlic, sage, and rosemary and cook until the mixture is fragrant and the paste begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the reserved strained marinade, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook until mixture is reduced slightly and thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and broth and return to a boil.",
          "Nestle ribs and their juices, meaty side down, into the sauce, cover Dutch oven, reduce heat to low and cook until pork is fully tender and falls off the bones, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.",
          "Remove and discard rosemary sprig. Transfer ribs to a clean plate and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Using 2 forks, shred meat, discard the bones, and return shredded meat to sauce. Simmer ragù over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until ragù is reduced to a saucy consistency, about 10 minutes.",
          "For the Pappardelle: In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta. If using fresh pasta, cook until noodles are barely cooked through. If using dry pasta, cook until just shy of al dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the package directs). Using tongs or a spider skimmer, transfer pasta to ragù in Dutch oven along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 2 cups (500ml) pasta cooking water.",
          "Return Dutch oven to medium-high heat and cook, stirring and tossing pasta until it is al dente and ragù clings to the noodles, about 1 minute. Add pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments to thin sauce, if needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide pasta between individual serving bowls. Serve."

        "steps": [
          "Place lamb in a 1 gallon (3.8L) zip-top bag. In a medium bowl, mix yogurt, garlic, ginger, and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt until combined, pour yogurt mixture over lamb, seal bag, and shake bag to coat lamb well. Leave zip-top bag in refrigerator to marinate overnight.",
          "Heat 1/4 cup (60ml) ghee or oil in a Dutch oven or saucepan with a heavy bottom over medium heat. Add onions, season with a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions caramelize and turn dark brown (but not black), about 25 to 30 minutes.",
          "Reduce heat to low. Remove half of the caramelized onions and reserve to use as garnish for biryani. Add 3 green cardamom pods, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, garam masala, Kashmiri chile, mace, and turmeric, and sauté just until spices become fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds. Add lamb along with yogurt marinade, water or stock, cilantro, mint, and green chile. Stir to mix well, increase heat to medium-high, and bring liquid to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover with lid, and cook for 30 to 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lamb is completely tender.",
          "Meanwhile, as lamb cooks, prepare rice. Pick over rice for any debris, then place it in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water, until runoff is no longer cloudy; drain well. Place rice in a bowl and cover with 4 cups (960ml) water and let stand for 30 minutes. Strain rice, discarding soaking water. In a large saucepan, combine rice with 4 cups cold water, lemon juice, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, remaining 2 green cardamom pods, and remaining 2 teaspoons of ghee or oil and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 2 minutes and then strain rice; discard cooking water. It will be partially cooked—if you break a grain of rice, you will see an outer translucent ring and a tiny, opaque inner ring.",
          "When lamb is tender, remove lid and increase heat to medium, stirring often to prevent scorching, and cook until liquid starts to thicken and reduces to about 1 1/2 cups (360ml), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Using a clean, large wooden spoon or spatula, spread rice out in an even layer over meat in Dutch oven.",
          "Set oven rack at the middle position and heat oven to 350°F (180°C). Place half the saffron threads in a mortar and pestle and grind to a fine powder. In a small saucepan placed over low heat, warm milk just until it starts to bubble, then turn off heat. Add ground saffron and remaining saffron strands to hot milk and let steep for 10 minutes.",
          "Sprinkle saffron-infused milk over rice, followed by rosewater and pandan water. Garnish top of the rice with reserved caramelized onions. Cover Dutch oven with two sheets of aluminum foil and crimp overhang to form tight seal, place lid over foil, and place Dutch oven in preheated oven for 20 minutes to let rice steam. Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes. Uncover pot and carefully peel off aluminum seal. Use a fork to loosen rice a little and serve immediately straight from Dutch oven. Alternatively, biryani can be transferred to a platter and served."

        "steps": [
          "Rub the turkey with 1/4 teaspoon each of the salt and white pepper. Choose a large pot with a lid, such as a Dutch oven, and place a steamer rack inside. Fill the pot with 2 cups (475ml) of water. Place the turkey on a dish that fits inside the pot and sits atop the steamer rack. (In order to save the turkey drippings, the turkey should not be placed directly on a rack with holes.) Bring water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cover the pot. Steam the turkey until its internal temperature close to the bone reaches 180°F (82°C), about 30 minutes. Let cool. Reserve the juices and drippings.",
          "Once the turkey meat has cooled, pull the meat into bite-size shreds by hand and discard the bones and skin.",
          "Heat the vegetable oil in a small pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the sliced shallots and cook, stirring, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer immediately to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve the cooking oil.",
          "Combine the shallot cooking oil with 1/2 cup (120ml) of reserved juices and drippings from the steamed turkey. Add water, sugar, soy sauce, Sichuan peppercorns, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and white pepper. Add half of the fried shallots, saving the rest for garnish. Whisk mixture over medium heat to dissolve sugar. Bring to a gentle boil and simmer, uncovered until sauce is reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Strain sauce and discard solids.",
          "To serve, scoop rice into individual serving bowls and top with a mound of the shredded turkey meat. Spoon the sauce over each bowl. Finish with the fried shallots and cilantro for garnish."

          "Lay one spring roll wrapper down with a corner pointed towards you. Cover remaining wrappers with plastic or a moist clean kitchen towel. Add a half dozen carrot/daikon sticks, 1 cucumber stick, 1 jalapeño stick, and a few leaves/stems of cilantro in a bundle in the lower third of the wrapper, keeping it in a nice, tight row. Roll from the bottom corner towards the top, keeping everything nice and tight. Roll until nearly half way up, then stop.",
          "The next step is to fold the left and right corners towards the center. Start by first pressing in on the edges of the filling with your fingertips to make sure it's packed nice and tight. Fold the corners towards the center, again keeping everything tight. Moistening the edges of the wrapper with a bit of water will help it stick to itself and keep its shape. You want the bottom edge to form a 90° angle with the new edge you've just created by folding over the corner.",
          "After both corners have been folded in, continue rolling towards the top of the paper. Moisten the top corner of the wrapper with a bit of water and continue rolling until the entire package is sealed. Repeat with remaining rolls until all the filling is used up. Finished rolls can be frozen for up to 3 months in a sealed container. If freezing, fry directly from the freezer, adding 1 minute to cook time.",
          "To Make The Sauce: Combine mayonnaise, chili garlic sauce, lime juice, and cilantro. Set aside. Sauce will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.",
          "To Serve: Heat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 325°F as registered on an instant read thermometer. Add 10 to 15 rolls and cook, agitating occasionally with a wire mesh spider, until golden brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately with spicy mayonnaise."

Using tongs, carefully add 2 deep-fried pork chops, handling gently to ensure breading does not fall off. Cover and simmer until the pork chop is fully cooked and registers 145˚F (63˚C) on an instant thermometer, 4 to 8 minutes. Gently remove chop and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pork chops.

          "Combine the cooled melted butter, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water, eggs, and vanilla in a blender or large food processor. If you don't have a blender or food processor, use a large mixing bowl and whisk by hand. Blend on medium-high speed for 20–30 seconds until everything is combined. The mixture will be silky-smooth and the consistency of cream. Cover the blender tightly or pour into a medium bowl, cover tightly, and chill in the refrigerator for 30–60 minutes and up to 1 day. (After refrigerating, if the batter looks separated, give it a quick stir before cooking in the next step.)",
          "Cook the crepes: Use the remaining butter for greasing the pan between each crepe. Place an 8-inch skillet over medium heat and generously grease it with some of the reserved butter. If you don't have a skillet this size, use a larger one, but make sure you keep the crepes thin. Once the skillet is hot, pour 3–4 Tablespoons (closer to 3 is best) of batter into the center of the pan. Tilt/twirl the pan so the batter stretches as far as it will go. The thinner the crepe, the better the texture. Cook for 1–2 minutes, then flip as soon as the bottom is set. Don't wait too long to flip crepes or else they will taste rubbery. Cook the other side for 30 seconds until set. Transfer the cooked crepe to a large plate and repeat with the remaining batter, making sure to butter the pan between each crepe. If desired, separate each crepe with parchment paper so they do not stick together. If you're using enough butter in your pan, though, the crepes shouldn't stick.",
          "Fill the crepes. I love serving them warm, but they're excellent at room temperature too. See my filling suggestions above this recipe or my recipe notes below. Place a few spoonfuls of your filling ingredient(s) in the center of the crepe. Fold both sides over the filling. Crepes are delicious with toppings, too, such as a drizzle of melted chocolate, melted peanut butter, or a dusting of confectioners' sugar. Or try a savory sauce like pesto or hollandaise.",
          "Leftover unfilled crepes remain fresh in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 1 day or in the freezer for 1 month. Freeze each between small sheets of parchment paper so they don't stick. (I usually layer them with parchment and freeze in a large zipped-top bag.) Thaw at room temperature before filling/enjoying.

If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges. For smaller scones, press dough into two 5-inch discs and cut each into 8 wedges. To make 10-12 drop scones: Keep mixing dough in the bowl until it comes together.

          "Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm milk, 2 Tablespoons of sugar, and the yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow mixture to sit for 5–10 minutes or until foamy on the surface.",
          "Add the remaining sugar and the butter and beat on medium speed until the butter is slightly broken up. Add about 1 cup (125g) of the flour, the eggs, and salt and beat on low speed for 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the remaining flour. Beat on medium speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes. Dough will be soft.",
          "Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat on low speed for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes. After kneading, the dough should feel smooth, supple, and elastic. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise.",
          "1st Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or butter. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 1 and 1/2 to 2 hours or until doubled in size.",
          "Grease the bottom and sides of a 9×13-inch baking dish or line it with parchment paper.",
          "Roll out the dough: Punch down the dough to release the air. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll dough into a 12×18-inch rectangle. Make sure the dough is smooth and evenly thick.",
          "For the filling: Spread the softened butter all over the dough. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together. Sprinkle evenly over the butter. Tightly roll up the dough to form an 18-inch-long log. With an extra-sharp knife, cut into 12 even rolls, about 1.5 inches thick. Arrange in the prepared baking pan.",
          "2nd Rise: Cover the pan and allow the rolls to rise until puffy, about 1 hour. (Or use the overnight option in the Notes below.)",
          "Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C).",
          "Bake for about 25–28 minutes or until they are lightly browned on top, rotating the pan halfway through. If the tops are browning too quickly, loosely tent a piece of aluminum foil over the top of the pan. Remove pan from the oven and place pan on a cooling rack for about 10 minutes while you make the icing.",
          "Make the icing: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until smooth and creamy. Add the confectioners' sugar, cream/milk, and vanilla. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 minute. Spread the icing over the warm rolls and serve immediately."

If you find the oats haven't soaked up any moisture after 20 minutes, give it a stir and wait 10 more minutes.",

        "description": "A perfect cream cheese pound cake with moist, dense, and flavorful texture. Made with 9 simple ingredients including cream cheese, butter, and cake flour, this recipe produces a rich, tender pound cake that's ideal for special occasions. Requires precise technique and temperature control.",
        "steps": [
          "Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C). Not 350°F. Generously grease a 10-12 cup Bundt pan with butter or nonstick spray.",
          "Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the cream cheese and beat on high speed until completely smooth and combined, about 1 minute.",
          "Add the sugar and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute, then add the sour cream and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined and creamy. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula.",
          "On low speed, beat the eggs in 1 at a time allowing each to fully mix in before adding the next. Careful not to overmix after the eggs have been added. Once the 6th egg is combined, stop the mixer and add the cake flour, baking powder, and salt. Beat on medium speed just until combined. Do not overmix.",
          "Using a silicone spatula or sturdy whisk, give the batter a final turn to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be a little thick and very creamy.",
          "Pour/spoon batter evenly into prepared pan. Bang the pan on the counter once or twice to bring up any air bubbles. Bake for 75-95 minutes. Loosely tent the baking cake with aluminum foil halfway through bake time to ensure the surface does not over-brown.",
          "The key to pound cake is a slow and low bake time. Use a toothpick to test for doneness. Once it comes out completely clean, the pound cake is done. This is a large heavy cake so don't be alarmed if it takes longer in your oven.",
          "Remove cake from the oven and allow to cool for 2 hours inside the pan. Then invert the slightly cooled pound cake onto a wire rack or serving dish. Allow to cool completely.",
          "Slice and serve with optional toppings like homemade whipped cream & fresh berries."
